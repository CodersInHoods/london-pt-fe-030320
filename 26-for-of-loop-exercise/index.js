 * Exercise 1
 *
 * create a function {getIntegersOnly} which takes an array

 * a new array with these integers. If there is no integers it should return
 * empty array.

/**
 * Exercise 3
 *
 * create a function {getEvenNumbersFromMixedArray},

 * Exercise 5
 * create a function {evenOddTransform} which takes

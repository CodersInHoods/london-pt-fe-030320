# Team Picker

Time to practice storing and updating state, and passing props.

You've been given some names in the state of App.

- Render each name in an `li` with 2 buttons: "Team 1" and "Team 2".
- Each button will add that name into the appropriate team's array.
- Render one `Team` component for each of the teams 1 and 2.
- Each `Team` component should receive an array of player names.
- For each of the player names, a `Player` component should be rendered.

# Your exercises are all here

We'll let you know when we deploy new exercises, you should then pull the changes from the original repo into your fork.

To do that, run this in your terminal:

```git
git pull git@github.com:CodersInHoods/london-pt-fe-030320.git master
```

or if you are using HTTPS

```git
git pull https://github.com/CodersInHoods/london-pt-fe-030320.git master
```

## When you want to push your code

```javascript
git status
git add --all
git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"
git push
```
